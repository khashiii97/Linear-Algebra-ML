# Linear-Algebra-ML
## A set of programs for solving different linear algebra and machine learning problems including:

### Using algebraic functions for classifying clothing images , including:
- Perceptron
- Kernelized Perceptron
- Mira
### Regression models between given X and Y vectors. the following four approaches are computed and compared:
- First degree polynomial
- Second degree polynomial
- Multiplicative inverse
- logarithmic


### The jupyter notebook contains solutions for the practial machine learning course home work, including:
- SVM with Guassian kernel, k-nearest neighbour, neural networks, and decision trees for classifying the MNIST dataset.
- Performing k-means clustering on the Iris dataset

### Using SVM and decision trees for classifying banknote authentications and mushrooms
